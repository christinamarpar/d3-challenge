					<h4>Teeth Removal and Poverty</h4>
					<p> This graph uses data on state poverty from the 2014 American Community Survey 
						one-year estimates and data on state tooth removal from the 2014 
						Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Prevalence Data. The graph demonstrates 
						a slight correlation between state poverty level and tooth removal. 
					</p>
					<p> The state with the smallest percent of individuals who have gotten one or more teeth 
						removed is Utah, at 33.2% and the state with the greatest percent is West Virginia, 
						at 60.3%. The positive correlation between state poverty levels and tooth removal procedures
						may be related to inadequate access to preventative dental services among the impoverished, resulting in the 
						need to remove dead or broken teeth. However, some teeth removal procedures, such as getting
						one's wisdom teeth removed, are in themselves measures of preventative care and would therefore be
						more prevalent amongst individuals with higher incomes and greater access to health services.
						This may explain why, although there is a positive correlation between poverty and tooth removal, 
						it is only a weak correlation of 0.5.
